# yetanalytics/runtimer

This repository uses GitHub Actions to create Java runtimes for use in Yet projects like [SQL LRS](https://github.com/yetanalytics/lrsql)

Create JRE runtimes:

1. Edit the [workflow file](.github/workflows/main.yml)
2. Push a tag
3. You'll find a draft release waiting for you for the given tag, describe and publish it.

That's it!
